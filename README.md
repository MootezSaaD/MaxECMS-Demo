# MaxECMS-Demo
MaxECMS, is a small platform for SMU students to benefit more from the university's materials such as exams, quiz's, problem sets
and so on. It will also include in the future a community where students can exchange ideas and collaborate on studies or share ideas
about their academic life.

The is platform is based on NodeJS as a backend framework and HTML,CSS and JS as front end.
It is a simple direct application of tutorials and lessons that we have seen about NodeJS and the other languages stated above.

PS: Please if you want to add something or have suggestion please do not hesitate, our goal is to improve this platform and maybe,
one day, deploy for other universities.
